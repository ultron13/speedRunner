# MarathonRunner Enterprise Implementation

This folder contains the implementation blueprint for MarathonRunner Enterprise, a Kubernetes-native performance testing platform inspired by LoadRunner Enterprise and extended with modern cloud-native, CI/CD, observability, and governance capabilities.

## Core Platform Intent

MarathonRunner Enterprise should include the major capabilities expected from LoadRunner Enterprise-class platforms:

- Centralized project and test management.
- Scenario design and scheduling.
- Distributed load generation.
- Load generator pool management.
- Real-time test monitoring.
- Results repository and historical comparison.
- SLA and threshold validation.
- Enterprise user, role, and audit governance.
- CI/CD integration.
- Support for multiple teams, applications, and environments.

It should also improve on traditional approaches by using Kubernetes elasticity, containerized engines, event-driven scaling, multi-engine execution, GitOps-friendly configuration, AI-assisted analysis, and integrated observability.

## AI And Recommended Enhancements

MarathonRunner should include AI features that help teams design better tests, detect regressions, explain failures, and make release decisions with more confidence.

Recommended AI capabilities include:

- Natural-language test design assistance.
- AI script review and scenario improvement.
- Intelligent test data recommendations.
- Anomaly detection during active runs.
- Bottleneck correlation across metrics, logs, traces, Kubernetes, Redis, and the system under test.
- AI-generated engineering, release, SRE, and executive summaries.
- Intelligent release quality gates.
- Capacity planning and cost recommendations.
- Policy-aware operational assistance.

Additional recommended platform features include service virtualization integration, Jira or ServiceNow integration, golden test templates, environment readiness checks, baseline approval workflows, test impact analysis, chaos testing integration, browser performance testing, and automatic cleanup of stale execution resources.
