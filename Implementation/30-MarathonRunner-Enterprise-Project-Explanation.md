# MarathonRunner Enterprise Project Explanation

## 1. Executive Summary

MarathonRunner Enterprise is a Kubernetes-native performance testing platform inspired by the core execution principles of LoadRunner Enterprise. The platform is designed to help organizations plan, execute, monitor, and analyze performance tests at enterprise scale while using modern cloud-native infrastructure.

The project follows a battle-tested load injection architecture:

- Jenkins orchestrates performance test pipelines and scheduled runs.
- Ansible provisions and configures Kubernetes infrastructure through Rancher.
- Docker containerizes the platform services and test engines.
- Harbor manages trusted container images for test engines, utilities, and platform services.
- Kubernetes provides elastic orchestration for distributed load generation.
- JMeter pods execute distributed load against the system under test.
- Redis provides high-speed runtime test data and coordination support.
- A configuration database centralizes test, environment, engine, and governance configuration.
- Grafana or Kibana delivers real-time monitoring, dashboards, and operational visibility.

Unlike traditional performance testing tools that are often built around a single engine or tightly coupled controller architecture, MarathonRunner Enterprise is designed from the ground up as a microservice platform. It supports multiple testing engines, distributed execution, CI/CD integration, scalable load generation, centralized governance, and enterprise observability.

## 2. Project Vision

The vision of MarathonRunner Enterprise is to provide a modern alternative to traditional performance testing platforms by combining the proven concepts of LoadRunner Enterprise with the elasticity and automation of Kubernetes.

The platform should allow teams to:

- Define and manage performance test projects across multiple applications.
- Schedule, trigger, and execute performance tests through Jenkins or platform APIs.
- Provision scalable test infrastructure automatically.
- Run distributed test engines as Kubernetes workloads.
- Monitor active tests in real time.
- Store, compare, and analyze results across test cycles.
- Enforce enterprise governance, auditability, access control, and repeatable execution standards.

The goal is not to duplicate LoadRunner Enterprise feature by feature. Instead, MarathonRunner Enterprise should leverage the core architectural ideas behind enterprise load testing, especially controller-driven orchestration, distributed load generators, centralized test management, result collection, and enterprise reporting, while implementing them with open, containerized, cloud-native components.

## 3. Relationship to LoadRunner Enterprise

LoadRunner Enterprise is known for centralized performance test management, distributed load generation, scenario scheduling, monitoring integration, and enterprise reporting. MarathonRunner Enterprise adopts these same core building blocks but reimagines them for Kubernetes and CI/CD-driven delivery.

Core LoadRunner Enterprise concepts reflected in MarathonRunner Enterprise include:

- A central control layer that manages test definitions, execution, scheduling, and result lifecycle.
- Distributed load injection using remote execution nodes.
- Separation between test orchestration, load generation, monitoring, and reporting.
- Centralized project and user governance.
- Support for reusable test assets, test scenarios, test data, and environment configuration.
- Real-time execution telemetry and post-run analysis.

In MarathonRunner Enterprise, the traditional load generator is replaced or extended by Kubernetes-based test engine pods. The controller and scheduler responsibilities are implemented through platform services and Jenkins pipelines. Infrastructure provisioning is automated through Ansible and Rancher. Runtime metrics are collected using Kubernetes-native and observability tooling.

### 3.1 Required LoadRunner Enterprise Feature Parity

MarathonRunner Enterprise should include the major features organizations expect from LoadRunner Enterprise-class platforms:

- Centralized performance test project management.
- Test plan and script catalog management.
- Scenario design with workload models, ramp-up, steady state, ramp-down, and duration controls.
- Load generator groups, pools, health checks, reservations, and capacity assignment.
- Test scheduling, recurrence, execution windows, and blackout windows.
- Manual, scheduled, API-driven, and CI/CD-triggered execution.
- Real-time run monitoring with active users, throughput, response times, errors, and load generator health.
- Runtime control actions such as start, stop, abort, pause where engine support allows, and controlled cleanup.
- SLA and threshold management for response time, percentile, throughput, error rate, and availability targets.
- Centralized result repository with run history, trend analysis, baseline comparison, and release comparison.
- Role-based access control by project, team, environment, and action.
- Audit trail for configuration changes, approvals, execution, cancellation, and result access.
- Enterprise reporting for performance engineering, release management, and governance stakeholders.
- Integration points for Jenkins, APIs, monitoring tools, defect systems, and release quality gates.

These features make MarathonRunner recognizable to teams that already understand LoadRunner Enterprise, while allowing the implementation to be more open, automated, and cloud-native.

### 3.2 Better MarathonRunner Enterprise Features

MarathonRunner should also improve on traditional performance testing platforms by adding modern engineering capabilities:

- Kubernetes-native elastic execution instead of fixed load generator machines.
- Multi-engine support for JMeter, k6, Gatling, Locust, Playwright, Selenium, and custom protocol drivers.
- Harbor-based image governance so every engine version is scanned, versioned, approved, and traceable.
- Redis-backed runtime test data pools with automatic partitioning, expiration, and duplicate-use prevention.
- GitOps-compatible test configuration and environment promotion.
- KEDA-based event-driven autoscaling for controllers, result ingestion, and execution workers.
- Kubernetes Operator support for declarative performance test execution.
- OpenTelemetry-based correlation between test traffic, platform behavior, and system-under-test telemetry.
- AI-assisted anomaly detection, bottleneck hints, and regression summaries.
- Policy-as-code guardrails for target validation, maximum load, image trust, environment access, and approval requirements.
- Multi-region execution for global traffic simulation.
- Cost-aware scheduling that chooses approved clusters and execution windows intelligently.
- Self-service dashboards for application teams with governed platform controls underneath.
- ChatOps notifications and optional chat-based test triggers for engineering workflows.

### 3.3 AI-Enhanced Performance Engineering

MarathonRunner Enterprise should include AI capabilities that help teams design, execute, understand, and improve performance tests. The purpose of AI is not to replace performance engineers, but to reduce manual analysis effort, expose hidden patterns, and make results easier to act on.

AI capabilities should include:

- Natural-language test design assistance that converts business goals into suggested load profiles.
- AI-assisted script review for missing assertions, weak correlation, hard-coded values, missing think time, and poor parameterization.
- API-to-test generation that creates starter JMeter, k6, Gatling, or Locust scripts from OpenAPI specifications.
- Intelligent runtime data recommendations for Redis-backed credential pools, token pools, counters, queues, and synthetic data.
- Real-time anomaly detection during active tests.
- Bottleneck correlation across load generators, Kubernetes, Redis, application services, databases, caches, networks, logs, metrics, and traces.
- AI-generated run summaries for engineers, release managers, SRE teams, and executives.
- Release risk scoring based on thresholds, baseline comparison, trends, and anomaly signals.
- Capacity forecasting based on historical test results and infrastructure behavior.
- Cost-aware recommendations for cluster selection, execution windows, and resource sizing.
- Automatic defect or incident draft generation with links to evidence.
- Operational assistant capabilities that answer questions such as why a test failed, what changed, and which dashboard or log should be reviewed.

AI recommendations must remain governed. High-volume tests, production-like targets, sensitive data, destructive actions, and release-blocking decisions should still require policy checks, RBAC enforcement, audit trails, and human approval where appropriate.

### 3.4 Additional Recommended Features

MarathonRunner Enterprise should also include practical enterprise features that make the platform more useful in daily engineering workflows:

- Environment readiness checks before execution.
- Service virtualization integration for unavailable or unstable dependencies.
- Performance baseline approval workflows.
- Golden templates for common test types.
- Test impact analysis based on changed services, APIs, or deployment metadata.
- Jira, ServiceNow, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and release management integrations.
- Browser-based performance testing for critical user journeys.
- Chaos testing integration for resilience scenarios.
- Data residency controls for multi-region execution.
- Tenant-level quotas, chargeback, and usage reporting.
- Automatic cleanup of stale jobs, namespaces, Redis keys, and object storage artifacts.
- Environment drift detection between test cycles.
- API contract validation before high-volume execution.

## 4. High-Level Architecture

MarathonRunner Enterprise is organized around five major layers:

1. User and governance layer
2. Orchestration and automation layer
3. Execution and load injection layer
4. Data and configuration layer
5. Observability and analytics layer

At a high level, the platform operates as follows:

1. A user, team, or CI/CD pipeline defines a performance test run.
2. The test configuration is stored in the centralized configuration database.
3. Jenkins starts the performance test workflow.
4. Ansible validates or provisions the required Kubernetes infrastructure through Rancher.
5. Kubernetes launches distributed JMeter pods based on the selected test plan and load profile.
6. JMeter pods pull images from Harbor and retrieve runtime configuration and data.
7. Redis supplies high-speed test data, coordination state, counters, tokens, or session values.
8. The system under test receives generated traffic from distributed load pods.
9. Metrics, logs, and test results are streamed to monitoring and analytics services.
10. Grafana or Kibana displays real-time dashboards and post-run analysis views.

## 5. Core Platform Components

### 5.1 MarathonRunner Portal

The MarathonRunner Portal is the main user-facing interface for performance engineering teams, QA teams, developers, release managers, and platform administrators.

The portal should support:

- Project registration and ownership.
- Test plan catalog management.
- Environment selection.
- Load profile configuration.
- Test data binding.
- Test scheduling.
- Run history.
- Real-time test status.
- Result comparison.
- Access control and approval workflows.

The portal provides an enterprise view of performance testing activities and helps teams manage tests consistently across applications and business units.

### 5.2 Control Plane API

The Control Plane API is the central service layer of MarathonRunner Enterprise. It exposes the platform capabilities to the portal, Jenkins, automation clients, and external integrations.

Responsibilities include:

- Managing test definitions.
- Managing test run requests.
- Validating execution parameters.
- Persisting configuration in the configuration database.
- Triggering Jenkins pipelines.
- Tracking run status.
- Coordinating result metadata.
- Enforcing role-based access and governance rules.

The Control Plane API should be designed as a stable integration boundary so that teams can trigger tests from CI/CD systems, release gates, chat operations, or external quality platforms.

### 5.3 Jenkins Orchestration

Jenkins acts as the main automation orchestrator for performance test execution. It provides repeatable pipelines, approval gates, environment-specific workflows, and integration with existing enterprise CI/CD processes.

Jenkins responsibilities include:

- Triggering test runs manually, on schedule, or as part of a deployment pipeline.
- Calling MarathonRunner APIs to fetch run configuration.
- Running pre-test validation checks.
- Invoking Ansible playbooks to prepare infrastructure.
- Deploying or scaling Kubernetes test workloads.
- Monitoring test execution status.
- Collecting result artifacts.
- Publishing run outcomes to dashboards, repositories, or quality gates.

This pattern allows MarathonRunner Enterprise to fit into existing DevOps practices instead of creating a separate isolated performance testing workflow.

### 5.4 Ansible Infrastructure Automation

Ansible is responsible for infrastructure preparation, provisioning, configuration, and operational automation.

Ansible should automate:

- Kubernetes cluster validation.
- Rancher cluster provisioning or registration.
- Namespace creation.
- Service account and RBAC configuration.
- Network policy setup.
- Storage class validation.
- Harbor registry access configuration.
- Redis deployment or connectivity checks.
- Monitoring agent installation.
- Test engine deployment templates.

Using Ansible creates repeatable infrastructure workflows and reduces manual setup errors. It also supports consistent provisioning across development, test, staging, and production-like performance environments.

### 5.5 Rancher Kubernetes Management

Rancher provides centralized Kubernetes cluster management. It allows teams to manage clusters, namespaces, access policies, workloads, and operational controls from a consistent management layer.

In MarathonRunner Enterprise, Rancher supports:

- Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management.
- Multi-cluster visibility.
- Namespace and workload governance.
- Centralized user and role management.
- Cluster policy enforcement.
- Operational visibility for platform administrators.

Rancher is especially useful when the platform must support multiple teams, multiple environments, or multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions or data centers.

### 5.6 Kubernetes Execution Layer

Kubernetes is the scalable execution layer for distributed load generation. Test engines are deployed as pods, jobs, or custom workloads depending on the execution model.

Kubernetes provides:

- Horizontal scaling of test engine pods.
- Workload isolation by namespace.
- Resource limits and requests for controlled load generation.
- Scheduling across worker nodes.
- Automatic recovery of failed pods where appropriate.
- Integration with secrets, config maps, persistent volumes, and service discovery.

This allows MarathonRunner Enterprise to increase or decrease load generation capacity dynamically instead of depending on fixed load generator machines.

### 5.7 JMeter Distributed Load Pods

JMeter is the initial primary test execution engine for MarathonRunner Enterprise. Each JMeter pod acts as a containerized load generator. Multiple pods can be launched in parallel to generate distributed traffic against the system under test.

JMeter pods should support:

- Loading test plans from a repository, artifact store, or mounted volume.
- Receiving runtime parameters from the Control Plane API or Jenkins.
- Reading test data from Redis or files.
- Emitting execution metrics.
- Writing raw result files.
- Supporting distributed execution patterns.
- Scaling based on required virtual users, throughput, or scenario design.

Although JMeter is the starting engine, the platform should be designed to support additional engines in the future, such as Gatling, k6, Locust, Selenium-based browser tests, or custom protocol drivers.

### 5.8 Redis Runtime Data Layer

Redis provides high-speed runtime test data and coordination capabilities. During large-scale performance tests, test engines often need fast access to dynamic data such as user credentials, tokens, account IDs, session keys, payload fragments, counters, or queue values.

Redis can be used for:

- Fast lookup of runtime test data.
- Distributed counters.
- Token pools.
- Session data.
- Shared queues.
- Scenario coordination.
- Avoiding duplicate data usage across multiple load pods.
- Temporary run state.

Redis should be treated as a runtime acceleration layer rather than the long-term source of record. Durable configuration and test metadata should remain in the configuration database or result storage layer.

### 5.9 Configuration Database

The configuration database is the centralized source of truth for platform metadata and execution configuration.

It should store:

- Projects.
- Applications.
- Test definitions.
- Test scenarios.
- Load profiles.
- Environment definitions.
- Kubernetes execution settings.
- Test engine settings.
- Jenkins pipeline mappings.
- Harbor image references.
- User permissions.
- Governance rules.
- Run metadata.

Centralizing configuration ensures consistency across users, automation, environments, and execution history. It also makes the platform auditable and easier to integrate with enterprise reporting.

### 5.10 Harbor Image Management

Harbor provides secure container image management for MarathonRunner Enterprise. It stores and governs images used by the platform and test execution workloads.

Harbor responsibilities include:

- Hosting JMeter engine images.
- Hosting custom test utility images.
- Hosting platform service images.
- Image vulnerability scanning.
- Image signing and trust policies.
- Versioned image promotion across environments.
- Controlled image access from Kubernetes clusters.

This ensures that test execution is repeatable and that test pods run known, approved, and traceable container images.

### 5.11 Docker Containerization

Docker is used to package platform services, test engines, agents, and support utilities into portable container images.

Docker enables:

- Consistent runtime behavior across environments.
- Simplified dependency management.
- Versioned engine images.
- Portable test execution.
- Local development alignment with Kubernetes deployment.

Each major MarathonRunner service should have a Docker image, and each test engine should be packaged with the dependencies required for repeatable execution.

### 5.12 Grafana or Kibana Monitoring

Grafana or Kibana provides real-time monitoring and analysis for active and completed performance tests.

Monitoring should include:

- Active virtual users.
- Transactions per second.
- Response time percentiles.
- Error rate.
- Throughput.
- Network usage.
- Kubernetes pod health.
- CPU and memory utilization.
- Redis performance.
- System under test metrics.
- Test engine logs.

Grafana is commonly used with time-series metrics such as Prometheus data. Kibana is commonly used with log and event data from Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. MarathonRunner Enterprise can use either one or both depending on enterprise observability standards.

## 6. End-to-End Execution Flow

The end-to-end performance test flow begins when a user or pipeline requests a test run.

### Step 1: Test Planning

A performance engineer defines:

- The project and application under test.
- The test plan or script.
- The target environment.
- The load profile.
- The number of users, arrival rate, or throughput target.
- The test duration.
- Required test data.
- Monitoring requirements.
- Pass or fail thresholds.

This configuration is stored in the configuration database and becomes part of the governed test catalog.

### Step 2: Run Request

A run can be started from:

- The MarathonRunner Portal.
- A Jenkins pipeline.
- A scheduled trigger.
- An API call.
- A release pipeline quality gate.

The Control Plane API validates the request and creates a test run record.

### Step 3: Jenkins Pipeline Start

Jenkins receives the run request and starts the appropriate pipeline. The pipeline retrieves test metadata, validates parameters, and prepares the execution workflow.

Typical pipeline stages include:

- Checkout test assets.
- Validate test plan.
- Validate environment readiness.
- Prepare test data.
- Provision or verify Kubernetes resources.
- Start monitoring baseline.
- Launch test pods.
- Track execution status.
- Collect artifacts.
- Publish results.

### Step 4: Infrastructure Provisioning

Ansible prepares or validates the infrastructure through Rancher and Kubernetes APIs.

This may include:

- Creating namespaces.
- Applying RBAC policies.
- Creating secrets.
- Applying config maps.
- Validating node capacity.
- Confirming Harbor registry access.
- Deploying Redis if required.
- Preparing monitoring integrations.

### Step 5: Load Pod Deployment

Kubernetes launches the required number of JMeter pods. Each pod receives configuration such as:

- Test plan location.
- Thread group parameters.
- Target endpoint.
- Redis connection details.
- Result output settings.
- Run ID and correlation metadata.
- Monitoring labels.

Pods are labeled with project, application, environment, test run ID, engine type, and scenario name for observability and traceability.

### Step 6: Runtime Execution

During execution, JMeter pods generate load against the system under test. They may read data from Redis, publish metrics, write logs, and stream status back to the platform.

The system should support:

- Ramp-up.
- Steady-state load.
- Spike tests.
- Stress tests.
- Soak tests.
- Breakpoint tests.
- Volume tests.
- CI smoke performance tests.

### Step 7: Real-Time Monitoring

Grafana or Kibana displays live execution data. Teams can observe:

- Whether the test is generating expected traffic.
- Whether load generator pods are healthy.
- Whether the system under test is degrading.
- Whether error rates exceed thresholds.
- Whether infrastructure bottlenecks are appearing.

This allows teams to stop, adjust, or continue tests based on real-time evidence.

### Step 8: Result Collection

At the end of the test, Jenkins collects artifacts and stores result metadata.

Collected artifacts may include:

- JMeter result files.
- Aggregated metrics.
- Logs.
- Error samples.
- Environment snapshots.
- Kubernetes pod status.
- Dashboard links.
- Pass or fail evaluation output.

The Control Plane API updates the run record and makes the result available through the portal or external reporting tools.

### Step 9: Analysis and Reporting

MarathonRunner Enterprise should support post-run analysis such as:

- Response time trends.
- Throughput trends.
- Error analysis.
- Comparison against baselines.
- Comparison against previous releases.
- SLA threshold evaluation.
- Infrastructure bottleneck detection.
- Application bottleneck correlation.

This turns raw load test data into actionable performance engineering insight.

## 7. Microservice Architecture

MarathonRunner Enterprise should be implemented as a set of focused microservices rather than one monolithic application.

Recommended services include:

- Portal UI service.
- Authentication and authorization service.
- Project management service.
- Test catalog service.
- Run orchestration service.
- Jenkins integration service.
- Kubernetes execution service.
- Test data service.
- Result ingestion service.
- Reporting service.
- Notification service.
- Audit service.

Each service should own a clear responsibility and communicate through REST APIs, messaging, or event-driven integration where appropriate.

This architecture allows independent scaling, easier maintenance, isolated deployment, and future support for additional test engines.

## 8. Multi-Engine Support

Although JMeter is the first execution engine, MarathonRunner Enterprise should be engine-agnostic at the platform level.

The platform should define an engine abstraction that describes:

- Engine type.
- Container image.
- Required inputs.
- Runtime parameters.
- Execution command.
- Result format.
- Metric output format.
- Scaling model.

Future supported engines may include:

- Gatling for Scala-based performance testing.
- k6 for developer-friendly JavaScript load testing.
- Locust for Python-based load generation.
- Selenium or Playwright for browser-level performance testing.
- Custom protocol drivers for enterprise systems.

The goal is to let organizations choose the right engine for each test while keeping orchestration, governance, monitoring, and reporting consistent.

## 9. Enterprise Governance

Enterprise performance testing requires more than execution. MarathonRunner Enterprise should provide governance features that make tests controlled, auditable, and repeatable.

Governance capabilities should include:

- Role-based access control.
- Project ownership.
- Approval workflows for high-volume tests.
- Environment access restrictions.
- Image approval policies.
- Test data access control.
- Audit logging.
- Execution quotas.
- Namespace isolation.
- Resource limits.
- SLA and threshold management.
- Result retention policies.

These capabilities help prevent uncontrolled load generation, protect shared environments, and support compliance requirements.

## 10. Scalability Model

MarathonRunner Enterprise scales by using Kubernetes as the elastic load generation layer.

Scalability is achieved through:

- Horizontal scaling of JMeter pods.
- Kubernetes node scaling.
- Multiple namespaces for team isolation.
- Multiple clusters for environment or region isolation.
- Redis for high-speed shared runtime data.
- Containerized engines for repeatable execution.
- Jenkins pipelines for parallel test orchestration.

The platform should also protect itself and the target environment by enforcing resource limits, maximum pod counts, approved load profiles, and execution windows.

## 11. Security Model

Security must be designed into the platform from the beginning.

Key controls include:

- Secure authentication.
- Role-based authorization.
- Secrets stored in Kubernetes secrets or enterprise secret managers.
- Harbor image scanning.
- Network policies between namespaces.
- TLS for service communication.
- Least-privilege service accounts.
- Audit logging for all test execution activity.
- Controlled access to test data.
- Approval gates for production-like environments.

Because performance tests can generate significant traffic, the platform must ensure that only authorized users can execute tests against approved targets.

## 12. Observability Strategy

Observability is central to MarathonRunner Enterprise. The platform should monitor both the test infrastructure and the system under test.

Observability should cover:

- Platform service health.
- Jenkins pipeline status.
- Kubernetes cluster health.
- Test pod health.
- Redis latency and memory.
- Test engine throughput.
- Test engine errors.
- Application response times.
- Application error rates.
- Infrastructure saturation.

Dashboards should be organized by:

- Current active runs.
- Historical run comparison.
- Kubernetes execution health.
- Redis runtime data health.
- Application performance trends.
- Release quality gates.

## 13. Data Flow

The platform uses multiple data stores for different purposes.

Configuration data:

- Stored in the configuration database.
- Used for projects, test definitions, environments, and run settings.

Runtime data:

- Stored temporarily in Redis.
- Used by active test pods for high-speed access.

Metrics data:

- Sent to observability systems such as Prometheus, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Grafana, or Kibana.
- Used for live monitoring and analysis.

Result artifacts:

- Stored in object storage, file storage, artifact repositories, or result databases.
- Used for reporting, comparison, and audit.

Audit data:

- Stored in durable platform storage.
- Used for compliance and troubleshooting.

## 14. Deployment Topology

A typical deployment may include:

- One or more Kubernetes clusters managed by Rancher.
- A MarathonRunner namespace for platform services.
- Separate namespaces for test execution workloads.
- Harbor as the enterprise container registry.
- Jenkins as the automation orchestrator.
- Redis as a runtime data service.
- A configuration database for metadata and settings.
- Grafana or Kibana for monitoring and dashboards.
- Ingress or API gateway for portal and API access.

For larger enterprises, the platform can be deployed across multiple clusters, with separate execution clusters for different business units, regions, or environment tiers.

## 15. Example Test Run Scenario

An application team wants to validate whether a new release can handle 10,000 concurrent users.

The flow is:

1. The performance engineer creates a test scenario in MarathonRunner Portal.
2. The scenario references a JMeter test plan and a Harbor-hosted JMeter image.
3. The engineer defines ramp-up, duration, target environment, and SLA thresholds.
4. Jenkins starts the execution pipeline.
5. Ansible validates that the Kubernetes cluster has enough capacity.
6. Kubernetes launches multiple JMeter pods.
7. Each pod reads runtime data from Redis and sends traffic to the application.
8. Grafana displays live throughput, response times, errors, pod health, and system metrics.
9. Jenkins collects result files and publishes the run summary.
10. MarathonRunner stores the run metadata and makes the results available for comparison.

This scenario demonstrates how MarathonRunner combines enterprise test governance with cloud-native execution.
